        The Milky Way Project shows you data taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
        What you see is actually the infrared light from deep within our galaxy, the Milky Way.
        This is not what you would see with your eyes.
        In fact, that is exactly why astronomers have collected so much infrared data in the past twenty years:
        we are trying to understand the diffuse material, called dust, that creates the beautiful structures in these images.
      '''

      g_02: '''
        We're looking into the cold, murky depths of interstellar space for interesting shapes and features.
        The bubbles and star clusters we sometimes see in these images are part of the life cycle of stars.
        Some bubbles have already been found - by previous studies, including the first version of the MWP - but we want to find them in other parts of the galaxy.
        The first MWP was so successful that we have expanded the search to new regions in the Milky Way.
        We're building up a comprehensive view of not only these bubbles, but our galaxy as a whole.
        We're asking you to help us map star formation in our galaxy.
      '''

      g_03: '''
        As well as bubbles and stars clusters there are other objects hidden throughout these images
        such as strange green objects seen near young stars (called EGOs)
        and never-before-seen galaxies that lie far beyond our own galaxy, hidden behind the stars and dust.
        If you see anything unusual in the images, make sure to mark it and give your best guess as to what it is.
        We hope to map out these objects and then use your discoveries to make future observations.
        You might even discover something we didn't expect, something truly extraordinary!

    bubbles:
      title: 'Interstellar Dust'

      b_01: '''
        Imagine holding a single grain of sand in your hand. Pretty small, right? Now shrink that grain of sand tenfold.
        This is roughly how big interstellar dust particles are.
        Yet this incredibly tiny piece of material exists in such huge quantity in the Universe, that it has huge consequences.
        Dust one-tenth the size of a grain of sand is one of the key players in the process of star formation.
        Massive clouds of dust and gas are what collapse to begin to form stars.
      '''

      b_02: '''
        The trouble is that this dust, composed of tiny silicon particles, is behaving in unexpected ways.
        It appears to be able to survive near hot, massive stars,
        when the interstellar winds and radiation pressure should force this usually cold dust to heat up and scatter.
        Bubbles are interesting places - they mark the locations where radiation from newly formed massive stars is impacting on the surrounding cloud material. We know this has a profound impact on the lifecycle of dust and gas in galaxies, and characterizing this effect is crucial for understanding how galaxies have evolved over the history of the Universe.
      '''

      b_03: '''
        The answer might be found in examining partial and closed rings - bubbles - that exist in the galaxy,
        and this is one of the aims of the Milky Way Project.
        By looking at bubbles in our galaxy, the Milky Way, we hope to get a better understanding of star formation,
        which can in turn help us understand these mysterious characteristics of the dust that is so important in creating stars.
      '''

      b_04: '''
        How is it that we know the bubbles indicate sites of active star formation?
        Because bubbles are made by hot stars, and hot stars are generally found dominating clusters
        containing several hundred to several thousand low-mass stars apiece!
        Hot stars also don't live long enough to move far from the clouds where they formed.
        All this means that each bubble represents several hundred to several thousand very young stars.

    introduction: 'Here you can find examples of the types of objects we want people to tag in the data. You can also find examples on the blog and Talk.'
    bubbles:
      title: 'Bubble Examples'
      description: '''Bubbles are usually circular or elliptical, but often only partially seen. They may be viewed as arcs of red in these data, sometimes brightening into pinks and whites. They are seen because ultraviolet radiation from young stars causes molecules in the surrounding gas to glow in the infrared. Bubbles will sometimes have obvious star clusters nearby, but not always.'''
    clusters:
      title: 'Star Cluster Examples'
      description: '''Star clusters are small groups of stars huddled together in these images. They are bright, often white or blue. You might see them inside a bubble, or on their own. Bright stars often create a cross-hair shape because of the light overloading the Spitzer detectors, this is normal and you don't need to mark those shapes as anything unusual.'''
    egos:
      title: 'EGO Examples'
      description: '''Extended green objects (EGOs) are small, irregular blobs of green. You may see them near bright stars, but they can also appear more isolated. They are quite rare and they are a special find: in fact, they were first identified in the images from this survey. There is much work being done by researchers to find and understand these objects.'''
    galaxies:
      title: 'Galaxy Examples'
      description: '''Sometimes when we look in infrared data we catch a glimpse of a distant galaxy in the background. These are sometimes seen in gaps in the diffuse emission of the dust, and they might be seen as lovely, spiral shapes or more-commonly as edge-on disks, seen as long cigar-type objects, glowing in red or pink.'''
    bows:
      title: 'Other Objects: Bow Shocks'
      description: '''Once in a while you might see bow shocks in the data. They are very rare but really interesting. They're so rare that we could only find two examples for this page! These could be large or small and they will look like arcs that form as stars push into the dust. These can be selected as an option in the 'other' category.'''
    pillars:
      title: 'Other Objects: Pillars'

      description: '''There are several different kinds of image artifacts in the data. Knowing where these are can be useful for the research team. These can be selected as an option in the 'other' category. <strong>However</strong>, we don't you to mark the large, blocky artifacts at the edge of many of the images (see below).'''
    stars:
      title: '''Don't Mark: Single, Bright Stars'''
      description: '''Bright stars are very common in the data and they sometimes produce long cross-hairs in the images, or strange shapes nearby. This is normal and we don't need you to mark these.'''
    edges:
      title: '''Don't Mark: Edge Colors'''
      description: '''Many of the images come from the edges of the dataset where there are one or more data channels missing. This produces triangular or zig-zag blocks of blue, yellow, or red. You don't need to mark these as artifacts because we know where the edges of the survey are.'''

  faq:
    title: 'Frequently Asked Questions'
    introduction: 'Here we try to answer some of the most-commonly asked questions about the MWP and the science behind it.'
    q01:
      answer: '''The images shown in the Milky Way Project were taken with a camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, as part of a survey called GLIMPSE, which aimed to map around 85% of the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. Over 440,000 images were taken for this survey. The galactic plane is where most of the young stars, gas and dust are located, and Spitzer is especially sensitive to those. The high resolution of the Spitzer infrared camera makes it possible to see fine detail in these clouds, and the bubbles we see are a great example of that.'''
      question: '''What are we looking at in these images?'''
    q02:
      answer: '''These images are from places all along the plane of the Milky Way. At night in darker areas you can see the Milky Way as a bright stripe across the sky. The region covered by these images is about as wide as a finger's length held at arm's length away from you, and stretches all the way around the earth following the brightest part of the Milky Way's stripe.'''
      question: '''What part of the night sky are we seeing?'''
    q03:
      answer: '''That's part of what we're trying to find out with this project! Right now our best understanding is that these are regions around young massive stars that are so bright that their light has caused a shock wave to affect the cloud around them and blown a bubble which we can see in infrared light. The red area is where the shock has already passed by and the bright green ring around it is where the shock is currently impacting the gas cloud.'''
      question: '''What are these bubbles anyway?'''
    q04:
      answer: '''Most of the circular features (bubbles) in these images are produced by hot young stars, as winds and radiation from these young stars sweep up the surrounding gas and dust from which they formed (like a snowplow that compresses the snow in its path.) Sometimes, the swept-up material becomes dense enough for gravity to pull it together to form new stars.'''
      question: '''What has this got to do with star formation?'''
    q05: 
      answer: '''Relax! We're sure you are. This sort of pattern recognition is something humans are very good at, and so just take your best guess at each image as it comes up. Several people will be shown each image, so don't worry too much about making a simple mistake. If you want some more guidance, then revisit the tutorial or read the extended version.'''
      question: '''How do I know if I'm any good?'''
    q06:
      answer: '''They're stored with those provided by everyone who takes part. The Milky Way Project team will carefully analyze the results to make sure that collectively we’re producing results that are useful to scientists — keep an eye on the blog for details. All results will eventually be made public for anyone to use.'''
      question: '''What happens to the classifications I provide?'''
    q07:
      answer: '''If you'd like to change your mind during working on a particular image, you can delete bubbles you've marked using the X button. Once you've finished an image, and your classification has been submitted to our database, then you can't change it, but don't worry — we compare classifications from multiple users so someone else will correct any mistakes.'''
      question: '''How can I change a classification?'''
    q08:
      answer: '''It is not possible to redo a classification, as we want each one to be independent. Allowing classifications to be replaced would open up the possibility of classifiers discussing images and changing their classifications to agree with one another. This would reduce our ability to understand the uncertainties in the classifications. However, don't worry about our final results: each image will be looked at by many people, so on average the classification is likely to be correct, and occasional mistakes don't matter.'''
      question: '''Can I redo a classification?'''
    q09:
      answer: '''If one person misclassifies these images it doesn't matter too much. The power of the project is that the crowd agrees and finds interesting and reliable data.. With multiple independent classifications we can statistically calculate the confidence in our work, and that's a large part of the power of Milky Way Project.'''
      question: '''Why do you need so many people to help?'''
    q10:
      answer: '''Light is a wave, specifically a wave of electromagnetic energy, and it comes in a wide range of wavelengths. Light that we see, or visible light, are electromagnetic waves that oscillate back and forth every 0.4-0.7 micrometers (there are a thousand micrometers in a millimeter, or a million micrometers in a meter). Infrared is light that has longer wavelengths, from 0.7 micrometers all the way up to about 300 micrometers.  The shorter-wavelength end of that range is called near infrared because it is near to visible light, and the longer-wavelength range is called far infrared.'''
      question: '''What is infrared?'''
    q11:
      answer: '''These images come from the Spitzer Space Telescope, from an instrument called IRAC, which took images at wavelengths in the 3-8 micron range.'''
      question: '''What wavelength are these images?'''
    q00:
      answer: '''All the stars you see in the night sky are part of a very large group of stars (a few hundred billion) that we call the Milky Way Galaxy. If you've ever looked at the night sky from a dark location, you've probably seen the band of light that we also call the 'Milky Way'. This band of light contains most of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, and the images you're inspecting all come from a narrow band only a few full moons wide along the Milky Way.'''
      question: '''WHY IS IT CALLED THE MILKY WAY PROJECT?'''
    q12:
      answer: '''All the objects you see are in the Milky Way, and essentially all of them will be on our side of the Milky Way since the stuff on the far side is mostly obscured by all the things in the way.  The objects you do see will range from about 1,000 to 25,000 light years away.  The more distant ones will probably be smaller and the closer ones larger, but not always! There might be some extremely large, distant bubbles that appear bigger than some small, nearby ones.'''
